Non-relational Database (no SQL/ not just SQL)

- Non-Relational Database Management System (NRDMS)
  + Help users create and maintain a non-relational database
    * mongoDB, dynamoDB, firebase, apache cassandra, etc.

- Implementation Specific
  + Any non-relational database falls under this category => so there is no set language standard
  + Most NRDMS will implement their own language for performing C.R.U.D. and administrative operations on the database
