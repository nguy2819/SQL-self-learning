Two types of Database:
1. Relational Database (SQL)
  - Organize data into 1 or more tables
    + Each table has columns and rows
    + A unique key identifies each row

2. Non-relational (no SQL)
  - Organize data into anything, but a traditional table
    + Key-value stores (Keys are mapped to values - strings/json/blob/etc.)
    + Documents (JSON, XML, etc.)
    + Graphs
    + Flexible tables
